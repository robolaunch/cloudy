- If you don't have a 3D printer, you can use a printing service.
- Once you've printed Cloudy parts, you have to acquire components in the mechanical hardware list. Those components in the mechanical hardware list are necessary to assemble printed parts.

## BOM Manufacture

?>As a starting point, you have to 3D print the mechanical parts of the Cloudy. STL files of Cloudy can be downloaded from the official Github <a href="https://github.com/robolaunch/cloudy_stl" target=”_blank” >repository</a>. 

All of the robot parts are completely 3d printable. We recommend using maximum 0.6mm nozzle and setting maximum 0.32mm layer 
thickness for printing non cosmetic parts for faster printing while maintaining minimum required dimensional tolerances.

 We recommend using PLA for all parts. For custom applications requiring more durable materials ABS, PETG or other high strength material 
can be used.
 
 Cosmetic parts are bodywork parts, thinner layer thickness, smaller diameter nozzle and slower printing speed may be preferred for better surface finish comrimising printing time.


## Print facts
The table shows the facts related to printing a single Cloudy.

| **Part**        | **Print time** | **Material amount** | **Material cost** |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Mechanic parts  | 62 hours       | 1035 gr             | (ESUN PLA+)$19    |
| Bodywork parts  | 132 hours      | 835 gr              | (ESUN PLA+)$16    |
## Tested Printers
The table shows the printers that are tested and successfully print Cloudy.
