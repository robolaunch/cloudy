# ROS Tutorials
In this part, we'll introduce some example applications for your future use-cases.
## Tele-operation
Teleoperation is the ability to control your robot remotely. In ROS 2, you can use a variety of tools to achieve this, such as teleop_twist_keyboard or teleop_tools package. With these tools, you can control the robot's movement, speed, and other parameters using your keyboard or a joystick.

?> To learn more about teleoperation, you can check out [**Cloudy Mini-AGV Teleoperation**](/mini-agv/software/sbcSoftware/rosSoftware/rosControl/). 

?> Also  check out [**ROS Industrial Teleoperation Tutorials**](https://ros2-industrial-workshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_source/navigation/ROS2-Turtlebot.html#control-the-robot).
## SLAM
SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. It is the process of creating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the robot's location within it. ROS 2 provides several SLAM packages such as Cartographer, GMapping, RTAB-Map, and Hector SLAM.

?> To get started with SLAM in ROS 2, you can check out the [**Cloudy Mini-AGV SLAM**](/mini-agv/software/sbcSoftware/rosSoftware/slam/).

?> Also check out the following [**video tutorial by Articulated Robotics**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ZaiA3hWaRzE) about slam_toolbox.
## Navigation
Navigation is the ability of a robot to move from one place to another autonomously. ROS 2 provides several navigation packages such as Nav2, MoveIt, ROS Navigation, and TeB Local Planner.

?> To learn more about navigation in ROS 2, you can check out the [**Cloudy Mini-AGV Navigation**](/mini-agv/software/sbcSoftware/rosSoftware/nav2/).

?> Further information, also check out the [**official documentation of Nav2**](https://navigation.ros.org/) and [**official tutorials**](https://navigation.ros.org/tutorials/index.html).

?> Also check out the following [**video tutorial by Automatic Addison**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIyhbMksHGY) and [**documentation here**](https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-install-ros-2-navigation-nav2/).
## Visual SLAM
Visual SLAM is a variant of SLAM that uses visual features such as keypoints and feature descriptors from cameras to estimate the robot's pose and the map of the environment. ROS 2 provides several visual SLAM packages such as ORB-SLAM2, LSD-SLAM, DVO-SLAM, and SVO.

?> To learn more about Visual SLAM, you can check out the [**NVIDIA Isaac ROS Visual SLAM**](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_visual_slam#overview).

## AR Tag Follower
AR tag follower is a robot or system that uses AR (Augmented Reality) tags to follow and track objects. AR tags are markers that can be recognized by an AR tracking system, which can determine the position and orientation of the tag in 3D space. By tracking the position and orientation of AR tags, an AR tag follower can follow and track objects that are carrying AR tags.

AR tag followers can be used in a variety of applications, such as industrial automation, mobile robotics, and entertainment. For example, an AR tag follower could be used in a manufacturing environment to follow and track a moving object on a production line, or in a mobile robot to follow a person or object in a dynamic environment.

?> To learn more about AR Tag Follower, you can check out the following [**tutorial**](https://github.com/alex-makarov/robaka-ros) and the [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP6Jw8Xr8P8).
