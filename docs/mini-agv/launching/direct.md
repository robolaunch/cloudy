# Directly Launching Cloudy Mini-AGV

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robolaunch/trademark/main/repository-media/cloudy/images/panel.jpg)
## SSH

Connect to the robot via ssh and launch the sensor nodes: (password: robolaunch)

```bash
ssh ubuntu@172.16.44.219
```

## Setting Up the ROS 2 Workspace

We have to initialize the workspace we are going to work on. Let's get started.

- Create a new workspace:

```bash
mkdir cloudy_ws/src -p && cd cloudy_ws/
```
- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robolaunch/cloudy.git src
```

- Init rosdep if you have not already

```bash
sudo rosdep init
```

- Install dependencies

```bash
sudo rosdep update && rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y
```

- Source your ROS distribution

```bash
source  /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash
```

- Build the repository

```bash
colcon build && source install/setup.bash
```

We have prepared the ROS2 workspace. There are several software packages in Cloudy Mini-AGV Software stack. 
For detailed explanation please check [**Software Packages**](/SoftwareDesign/Development%26Production/SoftwarePackages/) page.


## Launch Lidar

Launch `rplidar` and check the scan data:

```bash
ros2 launch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch.py
```

```bash
ros2 topic echo /scan
```
If there is no data on the topic, change the serial port of the lidar. First see the available ports:

```bash
ls /dev/ | grep USB
```

Then change the port with `'serial_port': '/dev/ttyUSB0'` parameter.

```bash
sudo nano /opt/ros/humble/share/rplidar_ros/launch/rplidar.launch.py
```
After the change source the ros distro once again.

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```
## Launch Stereo Camera
Launch `realsense2_camera` and check the scan data:

```bash
ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py
```

```bash
ros2 topic echo /camera/color/image_raw

```
The stereo camera should start working with the ```Node is Up``` message, it automatically finds the usb port.
If it does not give this message or does not print data to the topic, you can check whether the camera is plugged in with the command below. Unplugging the camera's usb cable and plugging it in may fix the problem.

```bash
ls /dev/ | grep USB
```

## Launch IMU

Launch IMU:

```bash
cd ~/imu && \
. install/setup.bash && \
ros2 launch mpu6050driver mpu6050driver_launch.py
```
## Launch Micro Ros
Launch micro ROS agent with the other port and push the little silver button on top of the robot:

```bash
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/ttyUSB1
```

Follow the instructions below in a remote computer which is connected to the same network as the robot. They would all work also in robots computer; however, since the nodes that are going to be run are computationally havy, this would not work optimally. 

!> **Do not** set the **ROS_DOMAIN_ID** of low level controller. It will not work if it is set.
## Launch Slam And Navigation

The launch files used for physical world are under `launch` folder. The config files that do not start with `_sim` are for physical world. Since Arcelik robot has different sensor set and since it uses different low level controller it has saperate launch files. The files starting with `arcelik_` are for Arcelik robot only. The files starting with `cloudy_` can be used both with `cloudy_v2` and `cloudy_v1` by setting the parameter `vehicle:="'<vehicle name>'"`, if the parameter is not set the default vehicle is `cloudy_v2`. 

First source the workspace:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

Launch `SLAM` for desired vehicle. If Arcelik vehicle is being used, lauch `arcelik_slam.launch.py`. If cloudy_v1 or cloudy_v2 is being used, launch `cloudy_slam.launch.py`. They launch the proper nodes for lidar sensor, laser odometry, ekstended kalman filter for sensor fusion, low level controller enabling `cmd_vel` topic, and laser filter to prevent lidar from seing the robot as obstacle. To launch SLAM with rviz set rviz parameter true by `rviz:=true`.

```bash
ros2 launch robolaunch_cloudy_navigation cloudy_slam.launch.py
```

Then in a new terminal launch `nav2` for autonomous navigation. This file only launches bringup for nav2 using the proper config file.
```bash
source install/setup.bash \
ros2 launch robolaunch_cloudy_navigation cloudy_nav.launch.py
```
