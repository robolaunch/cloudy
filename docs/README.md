**Introducing Cloudy: Our Robot Family**

Welcome to the world of Cloudy, our esteemed robot family! At robolaunch, we are dedicated to creating innovative and cutting-edge robotic solutions that cater to various domains and industries. Cloudy Mini-AGV is just the beginning of a lineup that encompasses a diverse range of robots, all developed under a unified documentation framework.

**General Robot Architecture: A Roadmap for Success**

To ensure consistency and excellence across our robot family, we have established a comprehensive General Robot Architecture. This architecture serves as a roadmap for the development of any kind of robot, providing a clear path to success. With its structured approach, we have defined 12 essential steps that guide the creation of robust and efficient robots.

**Cloud-Native Capabilities through the robolaunch Platform**

By following the General Robot Architecture, we have meticulously designed and crafted Cloudy Mini-AGV. This educational robot exemplifies the principles of our architecture, showcasing its practicality and effectiveness. From conception to realization, every aspect of Cloudy Mini-AGV aligns with this roadmap, resulting in a versatile and powerful learning platform.

At robolaunch, our overarching vision extends beyond individual robots. We aim to empower our robots with cloud-native capabilities, seamlessly integrating them into the robolaunch Platform. This integration allows for enhanced collaboration, data sharing, and scalability, bringing your robotic creations to new heights.

Cloudy Mini-AGV has been developed with this cloud-native approach in mind, leveraging the power of the robolaunch Platform from its inception. As you explore the possibilities of Cloudy Mini-AGV, you will witness the seamless integration with cloud services, opening doors to a world of advanced features and functionality.

**Embrace the Future with Cloudy**

Cloudy is more than just a robot family name. It symbolizes our commitment to creating intelligent, adaptable, and cloud-native robots that push the boundaries of what is possible. Whether you're delving into educational robotics, industrial inspection, agriculture or more, Cloudy serves as your gateway to transformative robotic experiences.

As we continue to expand our robot family, the underlying philosophy remains the same. Each new addition will follow the General Robot Architecture, ensuring consistency, reliability, and a streamlined development process. And, of course, all our robots will be equipped with the inherent cloud-native capabilities through the robolaunch Platform.
