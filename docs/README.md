## robolaunch Cloudy
Welcome to the documentation of robolaunch Cloudy.

Cloudy is a fully 3d printable, open-source and autonomous robotics learning and development platform based on ROS framework, allowing users to fully customize and modify the platform for their own educational purposes. You can run cloudy with /without cloud to offload limited robot computing performance in the cloud for unlimited applications.


- Powered by robolaunch platform:
    - Transfer your sensor data into cloud, process sensor data real-time in heavy AI applications using the best GPUs available and reflect the results to the robot!
    - Gazebo/Rviz/Isaac Sim(optional)/MuJoCo simulation over cloud VDI for virtual development purposes. 
    - Access Cloudy development environment with a cloud IDE in just minutes and start developing your algorithms on a cloud VDI.
    - Utilize NVIDIA powered Isaac ROS packages on cloud GPUs and run AI applications on Cloudy!
    - 5G Robot control remotely.(If available) 
- State of the art autonomous navigation stack (ROS2 Nav2).
    - Waypoint follower
    - Obstacle avoidance
    - Flexible algorithm selection and various plugins based on different use cases.
- Simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM) using LIDAR, IMU and motor encoders.
- Flexible and modifiable ros2_control algorithm. 
- Powered by micro-ROS, start developing your embedded software on ESP32 
and connect them into ROS environment! 

- Light enough to be carried in a backpack! (~3 kg)
- Strong enough to lift 20 kg payload!

## Source code

?> **Cloudy is a fully Open Source robot. You can check the repository from the [Github](https://github.com/robolaunch/cloudy).**

Why is Cloudy open source?

- Easily produced by generic 3d printers to be accessible to everyone in the world.
- Better performing AI, CPU heavy operations with native cloud integration with Robolauch (optional).
- Electronic hardware is fully customizable for unlimited applications without vendor dependency.
- Customizable mechanical parts to integrate different sensors without expensive impractical equipment.
- Focus on your specific needs, such as software design, with an inexpensive production quality platform
- For your next autonomy operation, payload delivery or any other fun software project feel free to join community. Create and issue, give feed back.
- Cloudy is available in both assembled and unassembled form, either as a fully-assembled product with different options or as a DIY kit. Both accessible from our store.


## Architecture

This roadmap shows the order of parts to be selected for robot manufacture for all robot types. Starting from step 1, you can create the robot you want to build. Cloudy Robot was created with use this roadmap.
