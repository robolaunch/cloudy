## robolaunch Cloudy
Welcome to the documentation of robolaunch Cloudy.

Cloudy is an open-source, autonomous robot based on ROS 2 framework designed for robotics education and development. We wanted to create a platform that will support robotics learning and education in the most accessible and customizable way possible. That's why we fully open-sourced Cloudy!

With Cloudy, anyone with access to a generic 3D printer can produce and customize their own robotics platform without any vendor dependency. The electronic hardware is fully customizable for unlimited applications, and the mechanical parts can be easily modified to integrate different sensors without expensive and impractical equipment.

Robotics development can be a CPU/GPU heavy and AI-intensive process, which is why we offer native cloud integration with [robolaunch Cloud Robotics Platform](https://www.robolaunch.io/) for better performance in AI and CPU/GPU heavy operations. With Cloudy, you can focus on your specific needs, such as software design, without having to worry about the limitations of expensive production quality platform.

Join the community to create, issue, and give feedback for your next autonomy operation or software project. Whether you prefer an assembled product or a DIY kit, you can get Cloudy from our store and start exploring the endless possibilities of robotics education and development today!

## Key Features and Capabilities
- **Open-Source:** By leveraging [hardware](https://grabcad.com/library/robolaunch-cloudy-1) and [software](https://github.com/robolaunch/cloudy) design, you can modify and create an entirely new robot for your own use case!
- **Accessible:** Easy to produce with 3D printers and fun to assemble it!
- **Scalable:** Suitable for customization with different electronical and mechanical hardware parts.
- **Affordable:** Starting from $990 Cloudy is available in many options in robolaunch store.
- **Rich Resources:** Comprehensive set of materials, tutuorials and examples to make easier to getting started from assembly to programming. 
- **Cloud-Powered:** Cloudy can be run on either a local device or on the robolaunch Platform. By running Cloudy on the [robolaunch Platform](https://www.robolaunch.io/platform), you can offload limited robot computing performance to cloud and also benefit from many additional features that will reduce your entry barrier!

## What can be achieved with Cloudy?
The Cloudy robot paltform is a highly flexible and adaptable robot suitable for a wide range of users, including students, educators, hobbyists and professionals. It utilizes micro ROS, ROS 2, Nav 2, ROS 2 Control, NVIDIA, and if desired, robolaunch Platform, enabling a broad range of functionalities:

- **Basics:** ROS learning.
- **Autonomous Path Planning and Navigation:** Cloudy moves autonomously around your lab, class or office with it's state-of-art navigation stack (ROS 2 Nav2)
- **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):** Cloudy autonomously explores unknown places using LIDAR, IMU and motor encoders.
- **Computer Vision:** Cloudy recognizes objects in its environment and avoids obstacles.
- **Map Building:** Create maps of environments for the Cloudy to use.
- **Teleoperation:** Remote control of Cloudy over robolaunch Platform.
- **Remote-Viewing:** See what your Cloudy robot sees over robolaunch Platform.


for any indoor mobile robotics application.
