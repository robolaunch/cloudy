# Getting Started
We have created a general architecture that can be used to develop any type of robot and make it cloud native. This architecture comprises the steps in the following architectural diagram and Cloudy has also been designed based on this architecture.

## Step 1: Chassis
To get started with Cloudy, first you need to decide if you want to build your Cloudy from scratch or purchase it from our store. You can find both Unassembled DIY kit and Assembled Cloudy from robolaunch store.

## Step 2: Set Up
After selecting the Cloudy chassis of your choice, you'll need to refer to the instructions provided in this documentation and follow the relevant steps. Once you've completed these steps, you'll be all set to use Cloudy for your intended purposes!

**Option 1: From Scratch**
If you want to begin using the Cloudy that you've assembled yourself, just follow the steps listed below.

- Order parts in [BOM](/agv/mechanical/bomMechanical/) for mechanical and electronical parts
- 3D print Cloudy parts by following [Manifacturing](/agv/mechanical/manifacturing/)
- Follow [Hardware Setup](HardwareSetup/assembly/) for mechanical and electronical set up
- Follow [Electronics](/agv/electronics/) for wiring
- Follow [Software](/agv/software/) for software set up

**Option 2: Unassembled Cloudy DIY Kit**
If you're interested in putting together your own Cloudy but don't want to buy the mechanical and electronic components separately, the Unassembled Cloudy DIY Kit would be a great option for you! Simply follow the steps provided below if this is the Cloudy version you've decided to use.

- Follow [Hardware Setup](HardwareSetup/assembly/) for mechanical and electronical set up
- Follow [Electronics](/agv/electronics/) for wiring
- Follow [Software](/agv/software/) for software set up

**Option 3: Assembled Cloudy**
If you've decided to buy Cloudy as a fully assembled product, you can easily get started by following the steps provided below.

- Simply follow [Software](/agv/software/) set up

## Step 3: Examples and Tutorials
Cloudy is accompanied by a comprehensive range of resources, tutorials, and examples, which make it easier to start learning and practicing robotics. By leveraging these resources, you can gain the experience you need to start exploring your own applications with Cloudy.

## Step 4: Endless Applications :rocket:

Cloudy is the ultimate solution for all your indoor robotics needs. Whether you're creating a delivery robot, a logistics robot, a disinfection robot, or a security patrol robot, Cloudy's powerful and flexible modular design makes it the perfect starting point. Its customizable hardware and open-source software can be easily adapted to fit any use case, providing a versatile base for all kinds of indoor robotics projects. So feel free to take the examples provided and modify them to make Cloudy perform new tasks. The possibilities are endless!
