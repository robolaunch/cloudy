# Cloudy AGV Use Cases
You can interact with your Cloudy AGV  for learning robotics at various levels of depth. It is a versatile robot that can be used for a wide range of applications, including:
* Low-level robotics applications such as embedded development and RC control, 
* Mid-level applications such as keyboard teleoperation, navigation and waypoint following, and
* High-level applications like AI applications, cloud tele-operation, visual slam, and fleet management.
