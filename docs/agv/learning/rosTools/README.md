## URDF
URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is a file format used to describe the physical properties of robots in the ROS (Robot Operating System) ecosystem. It is an XML-based file format that contains information about the robot's physical structure, including links, joints, sensors, and other properties.

URDF files are used to describe the robot's kinematic and dynamic properties, such as the position and orientation of its joints and links, as well as its mass, inertia, and other physical properties. This information is used by various ROS tools and packages for simulation, visualization, motion planning, and control of the robot.

URDF files can be created manually using a text editor or generated automatically using various tools and libraries available in the ROS ecosystem. URDF files can also be extended with additional information, such as the robot's sensors, controllers, and other non-kinematic properties, using other file formats such as XACRO.

Overall, URDF is an important component of the ROS ecosystem that provides a standardized way to describe the physical properties of robots and enables interoperability between various ROS tools and packages.
URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is a file format used to describe the physical properties of robots in the ROS (Robot Operating System) ecosystem. URDF files contain information such as the robot's joints, links, and visual and collision properties.
