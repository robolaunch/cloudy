Cloudy is equipped with an embedded system that serves as the central control unit for all sensors and motors. You can download your high level software to the embedded level by using the i2c, spi, can-busi analog, digital pins on the microcontroller and transfer it to real life. The <a href="https://micro.ros.org/"> micro-ros platform</a>, which can work with ROS2, is preferred for communication between the embedded system and SBC. It is a serial protocol that uses micro-ros fastdds technology and transmits industrial-grade data. As the microcontroller <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32"> Esp32 microcontroller</a> which is one of the easily found, cheap and performance chips supported by the micro ros platform, was chosen. The ESP32 Wemos D1 model was chosen for its compactness and compatibility with UNO shields that allow easy integration of additional hardware components.
