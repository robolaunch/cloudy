A stereo camera closely copies how our eyes work to give us accurate, real-time depth perception. It achieves this by using two sensors a set distance apart to triangulate similar pixels from both 2D planes. Each pixel in a digital camera image collects light that reaches the camera along a 3D ray.


## Robotics Applications using Stereo Camera
Here some robotics applications that can be achieved using a Lidar and also with Cloudy Mini-AGV:
* **Depth Perception and Obstacle Avoidance:** Stereo cameras can be used to create depth maps of the environment, which can be used to detect obstacles and plan safe paths through the environment. This is useful in applications such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and mobile robots.

* **Object Recognition and Tracking:** Stereo cameras can be used to recognize and track objects in the environment. This is useful in applications such as industrial automation, where robots need to identify and track objects such as products on a conveyor belt.

* **Augmented Reality:** Stereo cameras can be used to create 3D models of the environment, which can be used in augmented reality applications. This allows virtual objects to be placed in the real world and interact with real objects.

* **Human-Robot Interaction:** Stereo cameras can be used to detect and track human gestures and movements. This is useful in applications such as social robots, where the robot needs to interact with humans in a natural and intuitive way.

* **Quality Inspection:** Stereo cameras can be used in quality inspection applications to detect defects and imperfections in products. This is useful in applications such as manufacturing and assembly, where high-quality products are essential.
