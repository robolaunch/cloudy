LiDAR is short for Light Detection and Rangeing. In LiDAR, laser light is sent from a source (transmitter) and reflected off objects in the scene. The reflected light is detected by the system receiver and the time-of-flight (TOF) is used to create a distance map of the objects in the scene. 

## Robotics Applications using Lidar
Here some robotics applications that can be achieved using a Lidar and also with Cloudy Mini-AGV:
* **Mapping and Localization:** to create accurate 2D or 3D maps of an environment. These maps can be used to localize the robot and plan its path through the environment.

* **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:** to detect obstacles in the robot's path and avoid collisions. This is particularly useful in applications such as autonomous vehicles, where safety is a top priority.

* **Object Recognition and Tracking:** to recognize and track objects in the environment. This is useful in applications such as warehouse automation, where robots need to identify and track objects such as packages or pallets.

* **Surveillance and Security:** LIDAR sensors can be used in surveillance and security applications to monitor an environment and detect potential threats.

* **Inspection and Maintenance:** LIDAR sensors can be used in inspection and maintenance applications to detect defects or damage in structures or equipment.
