Ease of supply, ease of driving, torque and longevity were taken into account in the selection of the motor, which is one of the basic parts of cloudy robot electronics, and a stepper motor, which is used in many fields today, has been preferred. High current (1.7A) nema 17HS8401S motors can carry a load of about 30KG. You can increase the carrying capacity of cloudy with more powerful stepper motors with the same mounting points. If less current draw motors are used, cloudy's operating time will increase.
