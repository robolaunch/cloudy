In order to utilize the ROS and robolaunch platform, a Linux-based operating system is necessary. For small vehicles like the Cloudy Mini-AGV, compact computing systems are often utilized to fulfill the computing requirements. The Cloudy Mini-AGV's body has ample room to accommodate these computing systems. In this particular design, a Orange Pi 4 with 8GB of RAM has been chosen as the computing solution. robolaunch Kubernetes software works with k3s and it needs at least 8gb ram for k3s installation.
