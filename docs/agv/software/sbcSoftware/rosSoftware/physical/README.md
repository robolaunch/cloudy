Connect to the robot via ssh and launch the sensor nodes: (password: robolaunch)

```bash
ssh ubuntu@172.16.44.219
```
Launch `rplidar` and check the scan data:

```bash
ros2 launch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch.py
```

```bash
ros2 topic echo /scan
```
If there is no data on the topic, change the serial port of the lidar. First see the available ports:

```bash
ls /dev/ | grep USB
```

Then change the port with `'serial_port': '/dev/ttyUSB0'` parameter.

```bash
sudo nano /opt/ros/humble/share/rplidar_ros/launch/rplidar.launch.py
```
After the change source the ros distro once again.

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

Launch IMU:

```bash
cd ~/imu && \
. install/setup.bash && \
ros2 launch mpu6050driver mpu6050driver_launch.py
```

Launch micro ROS agent with the other port and push the little silver button on top of the robot:

```bash
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/ttyUSB1
```

Follow the instructions below in a remote computer which is connected to the same network as the robot. They would all work also in robots computer; however, since the nodes that are going to be run are computationally havy, this would not work optimally. 

!> **Do not** set the **ROS_DOMAIN_ID** of low level controller. It will not work if it is set.

The launch files used for physical world are under `launch` folder. The config files that do not start with `_sim` are for physical world. Since Arcelik robot has different sensor set and since it uses different low level controller it has saperate launch files. The files starting with `arcelik_` are for Arcelik robot only. The files starting with `cloudy_` can be used both with `cloudy_v2` and `cloudy_v1` by setting the parameter `vehicle:="'<vehicle name>'"`, if the parameter is not set the default vehicle is `cloudy_v2`. 

First source the workspace:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

Launch `SLAM` for desired vehicle. If Arcelik vehicle is being used, lauch `arcelik_slam.launch.py`. If cloudy_v1 or cloudy_v2 is being used, launch `cloudy_slam.launch.py`. They launch the proper nodes for lidar sensor, laser odometry, ekstended kalman filter for sensor fusion, low level controller enabling `cmd_vel` topic, and laser filter to prevent lidar from seing the robot as obstacle. To launch SLAM with rviz set rviz parameter true by `rviz:=true`.

```bash
ros2 launch robolaunch_cloudy_navigation cloudy_slam.launch.py
```

Then in a new terminal launch `nav2` for autonomous navigation. This file only launches bringup for nav2 using the proper config file.
```bash
source install/setup.bash \
ros2 launch robolaunch_cloudy_navigation cloudy_nav.launch.py
```
