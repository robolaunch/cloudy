1. [**Embedded Software:**](/agv/software/embedded/) 
Cloudy Mini-AGV uses a microcontroller for motor driving, sensors and electronics supply. It transmits the data it receives and needs to send to the computer with the micro-ros protocol.

2. [**SBC (Single Board Computer) Software:**](/agv/software/sbcSoftware/)
Cloudy Mini-AGV robot is a ros2 robot and it needs a simple computer. When the computer power is insufficient, you can limit your robot's power by connecting it to the robolaunch cloud platform.
3. [**Simulation:**](/agv/software/simulation/)
You don't need to have one of them to use Cloudy Mini-AGV. You can perform operations such as teleoperation, slam, nav, waypoint follower via gazebo and rviz2.
