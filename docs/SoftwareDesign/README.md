Welcome to the Software Design section of the Cloudy documentation. Here, we will delve into the requirements, development, and production processes of the Cloudy software. All of the software is readily accessible on our [Github repository](https://github.com/robolaunch/cloudy).

The Cloudy software has been crafted with versatility in mind and can be easily configured and modified to suit your needs. As the designers of Cloudy software, we encourage and welcome the community to get involved and participate in its development.

?> We are expecting PRs, issues and suggestions from the community. Feel free to contribute!

Now that we have a general understanding of the purpose of the Cloudy software, let's dive deeper into the software requirements and development processes. The following sections will provide a comprehensive overview of the software requirements and the steps taken during the development and production of Cloudy software. By gaining a deeper understanding of these processes, you will have a better appreciation of the thought and care that goes into creating this software.
